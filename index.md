<h3 align="center"> About Me </h3>
I'm a third-year student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, studying Computer Science. I assembled this portolio of projects from Human-Computer Interfaces, a class focused on UX design. This class was a fascinating and eye-opening look into the world of designing interfaces, and I look forward to applying what I've learned to future projects.<br/>You can contact me at <a href="mailto:npingal@wpi.edu">npingal@wpi.edu</a>

For this project, we were tasked with producing a visualization for a data set of our choosing. We chose to present data on the nutritional content of food, and decided to focus more on presenting it in a compelling manner, rather than presenting it as clearly as possible.  <a href="https://medium.com/@nicolas.pingal/design-for-understanding-presenting-food-data-c776ab06617f">More...</a>
